At least 12 opposition candidates, including a number of well-known veteran figures, have been barred from running in the Legislative Council elections in a stunning setback for the camp.
They include four incumbent lawmakers – the Civic Party’s Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu, Dennis Kwok and Kwok Ka-ki, as well as accountancy sector lawmaker Kenneth Leung.
Political activists Joshua Wong Chi-fung, Ventus Lau Wing-hong, Gwyneth Ho Kwai-lam and Alvin Cheng Kam-mun, along with district councillors Cheng Tat-hung, Lester Shum, Tiffany Yuen Ka-wai and Fergus Leung Fong-wai have also been informed by returning officers that their candidacies have been invalidated.
Through Thursday, at least 16 opposition election hopefuls had received inquiries from their returning officers.
